    Pages 1 to 4 and the first few lines of page 5, are the messages from insertion of two
    full valid profiles into the database. There were no real surprises here before a few other tests were run.
    These results cover test cases 0 to 12.\newline
    
    The errors following on page 5, marked error 1366,1406,1064 and 1452 are attempts at inserting data that is not valid
    according to our schema. first run of these test cases showed that we had a small flaw in the server setup.
    Instead of barring invalid data into some fields, it would just give a warning. Changing the mode of the database to strict fixed this,
    at least for strings into int fields, and to long strings, however, it will still accept an int value into a string field. \newline
    
    From the middle of page 5 and forward we verify one of the profiles that we have inserted, we only check one 
    of the profiles as we find it safe to assume that if we can insert 1 profile, we can also insert 2.
    During this process out test cases showed us that we the group did not share an understanding of the database schema, which
    also means that part of the server implementation made in our project, is actually incorrect.\newline
   
    Near the beginning of page 7 and til the end we attempt to read, update and delete aspect of the data set,
    this worked pretty much as expected, with the database changed to strict.\newline
