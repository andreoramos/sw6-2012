				\begin{itemize}
					\item Karen Tailor Smith is an educator at Egebakken. She wants to create her own profile in the system. She wants her user name to be KTS and her password to be oliver (the name of her son).
					\item She then wants to create a profile for one of the children at Egebakken. The child's name is Eric Carter, she chooses his user name to be ``Eric C'' with the password ``EC''. He should have access to TestAppe1, which is an app on the GIRAF system. She then sets herself as his guardian.
					\item Karen realizes that she wrote the wrong phone number for Eric and wants to change it.
					\item When the summer comes, Eric is done at Egebakken, so Karen wants to delete his profile.
