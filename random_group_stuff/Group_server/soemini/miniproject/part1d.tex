Our scrum sprint cycle is set to 14 days, with daily scrums. At the time of writing this text, the sprint cycle in the big group has not been fully decided and it it is decided to use a different
sprint cycle, we will adjust ours to match it. While we have chosen to use daily scrums, this should be understood in the way that our lectures may interfere. We will have ``daily'' scrum meetings
on days where we work  on the project.
