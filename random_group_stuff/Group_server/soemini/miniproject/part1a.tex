This project is about development of Android apps for autistic kids. The apps need to be locked down, so no other than the intended functions can be accessed, this is because autistic children often will press everything and anything they might see. The apps are being developed in cooperation with external customers, who sets the requirements for the different apps. A central module from last semester is being enhanced and a server will be implemented as well. Our focus in this semester is implementing a server to handle profiles of the kids, which contains various settings data, their profiles and stats for the different apps.
