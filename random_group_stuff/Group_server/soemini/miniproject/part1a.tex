This project is about development of Android apps for autistic kids. The apps need to be locked down, so no other than intended functions can be accessed at any time, this is because autistic children often will press everything and anything the might see. The apps are being developed in comparison with external customers, which sets the requirements for the different apps. A central module from last semester is being enhanced and a server will be implemented as well. Our focus in this semester is implementing a server to handle profiles of the kids, which contains various settings data, their profile and stats for the different apps.
