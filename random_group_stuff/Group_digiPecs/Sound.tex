\section{sound}

In our application we are making sentences by using pictograms. These pictograms consists of an image, as well as two optional sounds, as described in \textbf{INSERT REF!!!!!!!!!}, the reason for this being that it might help with communication and learning the concepts of what that pictogram illustrates.\newline

To use the a sound of a pictogram, the application needs to include an audio player so that the sound can be played. Fortunately for the development team, the group who previously worked on the project have already written a functional audio player
