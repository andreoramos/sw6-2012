\section{Target Platform}
In this learning project we are developing applications, for children with autism, using the android platform. The android platform was chosen because this project is part of a multi project, which began the development of the Giraf system \cite{SW6Android2012}.

Android is an open-source platform developed for mobile devices. The Android Open Source Project(AOSP) is maintained and further developed by the Open Handset Alliance(OHA), which is led by Google \cite{androidPhilosophy}. The companies from the OHA contributes to the project, these contributions are often made in form of engineering resources.

Android has a large community, spread over various websites, with different areas of expertise. This provides developers of android applications, with a community where they can find help with their niché \cite{androidCommunity}.
Google, which is head of the android development, also has a website for teaching application developers how to program for the android platform \cite{androidDevelopers}. On Google’s website they also provide various tutorials, so one can easily get started developing for the android platform.

In this project we have been provided with several Samsung Galaxy Tablets 10.1 
\cite{tablet}. The firmware on the tablets is version 3.2 \cite{android32}. This version has been chosen because, it is the first version developed mainly for tablets, and it is going to be supported for the duration of the project.
