\section{Target Platform}
In this learning project we have been imposed to develop applications for children with autism using the android platform[http://sict.moodle.aau.dk/file.php/628/SW6Android2012.pdf]. Android is an open-source platform and it is maintained by the \textit{Open Handset Alliance}(OHA) which is led by Google. Many companies are a part of the OHA, these companies contribute to the development with engineering resources.
