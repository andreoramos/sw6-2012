\section{Problem Definition}
In the multi project group, we have defined a preliminary problem statement, on which the individual project groups can expand.
The problem statement is worded as follows: 
\begin{quotation}
 ``How can we ease everyday life for children with autism and their guardians, through development on our target platform,
 while optimizing our development process by implementing a recognized project management method.''
\end{quotation}

This problem statement is necessarily vague to allow the individual groups some freedom in their projects, while we maintain the overall structure of the multi project, 
however there are limiting factors.
We are limited by resources and time available, as we are only working on this project for a single semester. However, all work done in this multi project
will be passed on to the next line of students, which means we can make a full system design and pass on anything we do not have the time or resources for.
This also requires that our work need to be of such quality that it is understandable by students of the same educational level as ourselves.
While not an actual limitation, we must adhere to the requirements of our customers, rather than working strictly with our own ideas as we may have been use to in previous projects.
