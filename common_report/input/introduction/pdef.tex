\section{Problem Definition}
In the multi project group, we have defined a preliminary problem statement, on which the individual project groups can expand.
The problem statement is worded as follows: 
\begin{quotation}
 ``How can we ease everyday life for children with autism and their guardians, through development on our target platform,
 while optimizing our development by implementing a recognized project management method.''
\end{quotation}

This problem statement is necessarily vague to allow the individual project groups some freedom, while we maintain the overall structure of the multi project.
While we have some freedom in the project, we are still limited by some factors.
We are limited by resources and time available, as we are only working on this project for a single semester. However, all work done by this multi project group
will be passed on to the next line of students, which means we can make a full system design and pass on anything we do not have the time or resources for.
That our project is being passed on also means that our work need to be of such quality that it is easily accessible by student of the same educational level as ourselves.
While not an actual limitation, we must adhere to the requirements of our customers, rather than working strictly with our own ideas as we may have been use to in previous projects.

\begin{quotation}
 ``Given our time frame and resources, how can we design and implement a system based upon android tablets, which help solve issues defined by our target group.''
\end{quotation}
