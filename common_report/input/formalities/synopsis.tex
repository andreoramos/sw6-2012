The Muttley and the Pigeon project involves two cars created with the use of the \lego{} NXT and implemented using the \osek{} platform.
%Muttley and the Pigeon is a project on \realtime{} programming.
%The project involves two cars created with the use of the \lego{} NXT.
These two cars, where one is the leader and one is the follower, are designed to follow each other as if it was a \roadtrain{} on a highway.
%The leader car is designed to stay on the road and not drive into anything, while the follower car is designed to stay at a safe distance behind the leader.
%This is achieved with the use of sonar sensors on both cars.
The leader uses the sonar sensors to avoid obstacles, while the follower uses them to keep track of the leader.
%The solution is implemented using the \osek{} platform.
