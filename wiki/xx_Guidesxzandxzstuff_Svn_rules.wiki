#summary This is a set of rules/guidelines which applies to svn

= SVN Rules =

    # When uploading to SVN, make sure that files are updated before committing
    # Make sure files and folders match, don't dump everything into a random folder
    # Make a log message when committing files, so people can follow what you are doing
    # Only upload files to your own groups folder or the main folders, don't edit in other groups folders
    # Update files a lot!


This is how you add a new page to the wiki:
Choosing the filename in the current format:
  x..x^n_1x_2x....{{{name}}}

The first x'es define what level you want the page to be, so if it's in General knowledge -> lulz -> Hello wiki page, then it would be 3 x'es.

If it's 3 steps in, there will be 2 parent folders, each split with a {{{_}}}, like so:

  xxx_Generalxzknowledge_lulz_Hello wiki page.

For making spaces in the parent folders one should use 'xz' instead, for making spaces in the name one should use {{{_}}}. So the name for the current folder would be:

  xxx_Generalxzknowledge_lulz_Hello_wiki_page
