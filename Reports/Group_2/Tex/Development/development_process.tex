\chapter{Development Process}
As stated in chapter \ref{cha:project_management}, the development method used in this project is a modification of SCRUM, which means that the development evolve through sprints. Here is a description of the six development sprints we had, and in section \ref{sec:backlogs} all backlogs can be found.

\section{Sprint Walk-through}
Because it took some time for all groups to agree on a development method, we started making some design and talking to our contact person before the actual sprints started, so when the first sprint was started, we already had an idea of the functionality we wanted to end up with.

\subsection*{Sprint 1: 19/03 - 23/03}
In the first sprint, the main objective was to set up the android project in development environment, and get the development started. At this point we were expecting to end up implementing the whole vision (see section \ref{sec:vision}), and a natural place to start would be the timer. We had an idea of how the design should be, and we began to implement lists for holding children and configurations.

\subsection*{Sprint 2: 26/03 - 04/04}


\subsection*{Sprint 3: 10/04 - 19/04}

\subsection*{Sprint 4: 23/04 - 04/05}

\subsection*{Sprint 5: 07/05 - 11/05} 

\subsection*{Sprint 6: 14/05 - 18/05}
