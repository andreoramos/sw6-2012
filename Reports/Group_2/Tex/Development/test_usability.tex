\section{Usability Test}
\label{sec:usability_results}

In this section we explore the results of the usability test, which was described in \autoref{common:sec:usability_test}. We focus only on the results for the Timer application, since we are not going to need the results for the other parts of the GIRAF system.

\subsection{Results and Observations}
Through the IDA method, we found six problems with the application, and they are categorized in table \ref{IDA_table}.

\begin{table}[width=\textwidth]

				\textit{Cosmetic} & 1: the users were not sure whether the attachments were selected, when they had chosen the attachments. 2: the user had difficulties finding the "Start"-button. \\
				\hline
				\textit{Serious} & 1: the user had difficulties using the imported Android color palette. 2: deletion by long-click is not intuitive. 3: the "Last Used" list was difficult to find. \\
