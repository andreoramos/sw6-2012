\end{quotation}


%keep abreast of = følge med situationene osv. eksempel: He tried to keep abreast of all developments (Han prøvede at følge all udviklinger)
To comply with the study regulations did the five project groups create one unified system.
The project groups have been using the same development method to ensure that all project groups have had the possibility to keep abreast of the multi project, \autoref{sec:dev_meth}.\\

The groups did together make the system GIRAF, a collection of the projects of the semester, of which this project has focused on the timer application, WOMBAT.
The timer application is designed to replace the physical timers that the guardians use today, \autoref{sec:sys_def} and \autoref{cha:design}.\\

The usability test proves that the application is user friendly for the educators in the test group, \autoref{sec:usability_results}.
Furthermore does the acceptance test prove that the children, understand the meaning of the timers and attached pictograms, \autoref{sec:accept_test}. The pictograms is a new feature that the educators did not have available previously with the physical timers, \autoref{??} \textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{Der hvor mette foreslår det!}.\\

The timer application is configurable to match any timer the educators use today, \autoref{subsec:cust_arch}, further can the educators attach pictograms or timers to the timers as an extention to the physical timers, \autoref{subsubsec:attach}.\\ 

The timer application is easy to use, as proven by the tests, as well as being physically smaller than the current timers, therefore do we conclude that the timer application can ease the daily life for children with ASD and their guardians.\\
