\textit{The introduction consisted of two parts: a common part were general subjects for the whole multi project was presented, and an analysis of the problem area with a focus on the timer group as an individual.}\\

\textit{We have learned that children with ASD are visual in they way of communication, and existing electronic communicational aiding systems are expensive.
Therefore we want to build a low cost system, with Android tablets as target platform, to aid the children and their guardians in their everyday.}\\

\textit{We, the timer group, focus on building a timer application, to help the guardians visualize time progressing for the children.
This application is a part of a collection of software components, which together forms the GIRAF system.}\\

\textit{Since there are 18 students, divided into five project groups, working on the same software system, and there is no concrete system specification to develop out from, we have chosen to use an agile development method, Scrum of Scrums, because we expect changes in system requirements during the development process.}
