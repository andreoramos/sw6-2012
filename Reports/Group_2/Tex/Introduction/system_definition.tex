\chapter{System Definition}
The application we are developing is targeted for android tablets running Android 3.2. The use space is institutions and homes of autistic children.\\
   The application is meant as a tool, such that parents and educators can visualize time in a way customized for each child by changing color schemes, symbols, forms, and save this information in profiles stored on a server. The visualization is formed as a full-screen timer, which can be customized to be shown as an hour glass or a stop watch.\\
  In addition, the timer application should be used to control the allowed time spent on other applications, such as games. When the launcher is in autist mode, the timer application should be opened as an overlay whenever another application is opened. This overlay shows how much time is left, and when the time is up, it will lock the given application with a customized cooldown. Also the timer application should include a timelock, such that other applications are only available in specific time spans.
