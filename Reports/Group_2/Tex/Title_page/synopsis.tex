This project is about the development of an Android timer application that will ease the daily routine for both children with ASD and their guardians. Guardians use physical timers to help the children manage their activities, these timers exists in a variety of forms, colors, and amount of maximum time that they can show. Furthermore the guardians uses pictograms to inform the children, what activity is currently in progress or be used as a scheme to describe their daily routines. The timer application is developed with the goal to replace the physical timers by providing visual timers in a variety of forms, colors, and time. The timer application is developed so the guardians can attach an extra timer or single/multiple pictograms next to the original timer.

This project is a part of the multi project group system, GIRAF. GIRAF is a system specifically developed to ease the daily routine for guardians by providing a collection of tools, here among the timer application.
