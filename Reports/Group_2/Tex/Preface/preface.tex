\chapter*{Preface}
This project has been produced by group SW602f12 at Aalborg University in the spring 2012 on the sixth semester of the software engineering study.\\

This project is written in light of developments of the timer application for the The GIRAF Project. The GIRAF Project is designed to support educators in schools for children with ASD, among these is the timer application that is built to replace the timers the institutions have provided.\\

The project describes the working process used to develop the product, included in this is the development method, the design, the implemented features, and the tests of the timer application.\\

The intent of the project is to explore the possibilities of combining tools used by educators for children with ASD, in a device which is portable and easy to use.\\

The project group would like to thank the educators whom helped developing and designing the timer application as well as our supervisor for the interest and cooperation in the project.
