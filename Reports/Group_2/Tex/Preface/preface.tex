\chapter*{Preface}
This project has been produced by group SW602f12 at Aalborg University in the spring 2012 on the sixth semester of the software engineering study.\\

This project is written as a part of the process of developing the timer application for the GIRAF project. The GIRAF project is designed to support guardians of children with autism spectrum disorder, among the applications in the GIRAF project is the timer application that is built to replace physical timers.\\

The project describes the working process used to develop the timer application, included in this is the development method, the design, the implemented features, and the tests of the timer application.\\

The intent of the project is to explore the possibilities of combining tools used by guardians of children with autism spectrum disorder, in a device which is portable and easy to use.\\

The project group would like to thank the educators whom helped developing and designing the timer application as well as our supervisor for the interest and cooperation in the project.
