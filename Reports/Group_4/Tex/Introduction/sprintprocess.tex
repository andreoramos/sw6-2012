\chapter{Sprint Process}
\label{ch:SprintProcess}
In this chapter we describe the sprint process of our project. In the project period we underwent eight sprints. The length of the sprints was decided at every sprint meeting, but they were usually no longer than 10 half days long. At the end of every sprint period, we held a meeting to discuss what we learned through the sprint, and if all the tasks was finished. In the following a description of the different sprints is presented. The Burndown charts and sprint backlogs can be seen in the Appendix \vref{sec:burn_back}.

\section{Sprints}
\subsection{Sprint One}
Sprint one started on 19/03-2012 and lasted seven half days. In this sprint period we started making the local database, the model objects, that is supposed to wrap the data from the database, and some methods to the library, we got as requirements from the other groups.

\subsubsection{Experience gained}
In this sprint we learned that we should be a bit better at estimating the time of each task and that we needed to combine the tasks into bigger tasks, so we could work one big task a day, instead of 10 small tasks.

\subsection{Sprint Two}
Sprint two started on 26/03-2012 and lasted eight half days. In this sprint period we updated the local database and the library with the new requirements we got from the other groups. Besides that we used a little time on setting a counter-strike server up, so we had something to do socially between the groups.

\subsubsection{Experience gained}
In this sprint we learned that we still should be a bit better at estimating the time of each task, because there was some tasks we did not even start on.

\subsection{Sprint three}
Sprint three started on 10/04-2012 and lasted 9 half days. In this sprint period we continued on updating the local database and library with the new requirements gathered from the other groups. Besides that we started thinking on our "`BMI App"', which is not necessary a BMI application, but it is an application, which shows the functionality of the library and local database.

\subsubsection{Experience gained}
In this sprint we learned that we should be a bit better at not taking new tasks in to the sprint backlog when the sprint has started, because this will prevent us from making any progress. Besides that we overestimated the size of the tasks, which lead to tasks not being completed before the end of the sprint, because they are connected to each other.

\subsection{Sprint four}
Sprint four started on 23/04-2012 and lasted 6 half days. In this sprint period we continued on updating the local database and library with the new requirements gathered from the other groups. Besides that we started writing javadoc to the library, re factored the code in the local database, started making a method, which created dummy data, and wrote a section of the common report (Target Platform and Developing method).

\subsubsection{Experience gained}
In this sprint we learned that we still needs to be better at saying no to other groups, which come with new tasks in the middle of the sprint period.

\subsection{Sprint five}
Sprint five started on 07/05-2012 and lasted 6 half days. In this sprint we worked on the Oasis app, adding functionality to it. We also planed to work on syncronizing with the online database, that did not happen due to the server side not being ready. We improved the library with minor bug fixes.

\subsubsection{Experience gained}
In this sprint we learned to get information beforehand on what functionality is available from other people, before trying to use it. We also learned that our structure of the Oasis library could be better.

\subsection{Sprint six}
Sprint six started on 14/05-2012 and lasted 8 half days. In this sprint we continued work on the Oasis App, adding extra functionality to the library, and started creating a structure for the rapport.

\subsubsection{Experience gained}
In this sprint we learned that working together on the same files can be a challenge. And that SVN errors can happen easy if two people are editing the same files, without telling eachother.

\subsection{Sprint seven}
Sprint seven started on 21/05-2012 and lasted 9 half days. In this sprint we worked on makeing unit tests for Oasis app. In this sprint, we also had the usability test, where we testet the Oasis app. We also added more content to the rapport.

\subsubsection{Experience gained}
in this sprint we learned that not every choice you make as a programmer is easy to understand for someone without much technical knowledge.

\subsection{Sprint eight}
Sprint eight started on 28/05-2012 and lasted 8 half days. In this sprint we finished the report.

\subsubsection{Experience gained}
In this sprint we learned that writing some parts of the report earlier might be a good idea.

\subsection{Change Log}
In almost every sprint changes have been made in the software platform.
All these changes have been accumelated into a change log.
The change log can be seen in \autoref{sec:change_log}.
