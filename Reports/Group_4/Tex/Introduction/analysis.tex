\chapter{Analysis}
As a part of the multi project, we are not directly solving the problem ourselves, but providing a part such that the other project groups can perform that task easier.
As we did not solve the problem directly we have made our own problem definition:
	\textit{How can we provide a set of tools which can help develop application for the GIRAF-system?}
As a way to solve this we have chosen to make 3 projects, a library providing methods and classes, a database to save information and an application to control the content of the database. 

\section{Requirements}
When we where to develop our library we asked the other groups to supply requirements. We received the following requirements:
Save data on the device
Various classes for:
Profiles
Media
Apps
Departments
From this we derived some features which will be shown in appendix FeatureList.
