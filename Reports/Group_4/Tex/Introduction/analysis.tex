\chapter{Analysis}
As a part of the multi project, we are not directly solving the problem ourselves, but providing a part such that the other project groups can perform that task easier.
As we did not solve the problem directly we have made our own problem definition:
	\textit{How can we provide a set of tools which can help develop application for the GIRAF-system?}
As a way to solve this we have chosen to make 3 projects, a library providing methods and classes, a database to save information and an application to control the content of the database. 

\section{Requirements}
Before the development can begin the requirements for the software must be analysed.
The requirements stem from several places because we are to develop a database with a library, which are to be used by GIRAF applications.
Therefore both application specific and general requirements have been devised.

The informal requirements are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Child profile handling
	\item Guardian profile handling
	\item Child and guardian relation handling
	\item Application specific profile setting handling
	\item Certificate handling
	\item Media handling
	\item Media access handling
	\item Media to media relation handling
	\item Department handling
	\item Department to subdepartment handling
	\item Profile to department relation handling
\end{itemize}

As an example for the requirements received from the other groups, see appendix \vref{sec:timerreq}.

\section{System architecture}
\subsection{In the multi project}
The way Oasis fit into the multi project, is by being a middle layer between the Apps and the server, as seen in figure \vref{fig:bigPic}. Oasis will handle the communication from the apps to save in the local database, as well as synchronizing the local database, with the server.

\subsection{Each part}
Oasis consists of 3 parts, the oasis library which is the core of the project, the administration app, and the local database, as shown in figure \vref{fig:smallPic}. The Oasis library will handle applications interaction with the local database, and every giraf app should be utilizing this library. The Oasis library will also make sure that the local database is synchronized with the server's database.
The administration application is an app from which the user can interact with the database directly, creating or deleting users and departments, and making sure these are connected.
