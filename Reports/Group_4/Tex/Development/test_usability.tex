\section{Usability Test}
We decided to have a usability test performed on the Oasis App eventhough it was not completed.
This gives a unique oppertunity to modify the app before it is done.

The approach for the usability test can be found in \autoref{common:sec:usability_test}.
The questions for this specific usability test can be seen in \autoref{sec:usability_questions}.

\subsection{Results and Observations}
\label{sec:usability_results}
The result of the usability test can be seen in \autoref{tab:usability_test_results} here it can be seen that the are the following number of issues:
two cosmetic issues, two serious issues, and one critical issue.
