\section{Usability Test}
We decided to have a usability test performed on the Oasis App eventhough it was not completed.
This gives a unique opportunity to modify the appplication before it is done.

The approach for the usability test can be found in \vref{common:sec:usability_test}.
The questions for the usability test of the Oasis App can be seen in \vref{sec:usability_questions}.

\subsection{Results and Observations}
\label{sec:usability_results}
The result of the usability test can be seen in Table \vref{tab:usability_test_results}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
