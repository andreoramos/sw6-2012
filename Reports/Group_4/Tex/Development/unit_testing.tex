\section{Dynamic White Box Testing}
\label{sec:DynamicWhiteBoxTesting}
To ensure the correctness of the Oasis Library we enforce dynamic white box testing through unit tests. kilde: http://aulas.carlosserrao.net/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=0910:1008-1987_ieee_standard_for_software_unit_testing.pdf
The library is used by all GIRAF applications this means that if a bug exists in the library there is a potential bug in all GIRAF application.
Therefore the library must be thoroughly tested to make sure that little or no bugs exists.
A test plan has been derived for this project in order to make it easier to create the test suite.
