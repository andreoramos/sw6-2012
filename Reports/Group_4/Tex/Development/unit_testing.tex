\section{Dynamic White Box Testing}
\label{sec:DynamicWhiteBoxTesting}
To ensure the correctness of the Oasis Library we enforce dynamic white box testing(side 106 - 107, Software Testing - af Ron Patton) through unit tests.

The library is used by all GIRAF applications this means that if a bug exists in the library there is a potential bug in all GIRAF application.
Therefore the library must be thoroughly tested to make sure that few or no bugs exists.

\subsection{Test Plan}
As this project have been developed using the agile development methods Scrum we have not devised a full test plan(side 263 - 275, Software Testing - af Ron Patton) as this is not needed.
As a part of Scrum we have been testing the code snippets before they have been marked as completed.
A decision has been made \autoref{sec:somewhereInTheLibSection} to make a full functioning library for this semester.
This decision means that the development time has to be prioritized and therefore the focus will be on test-to-pass tests.
This ensures that the library will function as intended, though there is no guarantee that the library will work if bad parameters are used.

\subsubsection{Test Design}
A test design(side 281 - 282, Software testing - af Ron Patton) have been elaborated for each method in the helper classes of the Oasis Library.
This way the library methods will be tested along with the database thus saving some time.
This means that the tests will be more efficient as more code will be tested in every test, but it has the drawback that if a bug is found more code will have to be investigated in order to locate the bug.
