This report was written as a 6th semester bachelor project by Software group sw604f12 from the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University (AAU) in the spring of 2012. The report will document the process of developing an administration module for the GIRAF system. The GIRAF system is designed to support guardians of children with autism spectrum disorder.

When references are used in the report they will be referred to in the format [abc] with a corresponding entry in the bibliography (located in the back of the report). For larger works a range of relevant pages will also be specified in the format [pp.~10]. Figures, tables and equations will be referred to in the format [2.1], where the first number refers to the chapter in which it is placed and the second number is the actual number of the figure, table or equation.

The reader is expected to have an understanding of basic programming concepts.
