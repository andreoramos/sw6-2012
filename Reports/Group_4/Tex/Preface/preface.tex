This report was written as a 6th semester project by a group of software students from the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University (AAU) in the spring of 2012. The report will document the process of developing an administration module of the GIRAF system. The GIRAF system is designed to support guardians of children with autism spectrum disorder.
