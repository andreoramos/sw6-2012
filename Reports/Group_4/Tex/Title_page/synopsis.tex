Oasis is an administration module for the GIRAF system. The GIRAF system is designed to ease the daily routine for guardians of children with ASD. Oasis will provide tools for the development of applications for the GIRAF platform. Oasis consists of three parts; a database used to store information, a library that supplies an API, and a Oasis administration app. We tested the functionality of Oasis, using unit testing and a usability test.
