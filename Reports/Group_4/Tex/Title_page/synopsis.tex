Oasis is an administration module for the GIRAF system. The GIRAF system is designed to 
ease the daily routine for guardians of children with ASD. 

Oasis will provide tools for the development of applications for the GIRAF platform. Oasis consists of three parts; a database used to store information, a library that supplies an API, and an administration application. We tested the functionality of Oasis, using unit testing and a usability test. 

The Oasis tools are used in the development of various applications for the GIRAF platform. Even though we released a working version of Oasis, the tools are still open for further development.
