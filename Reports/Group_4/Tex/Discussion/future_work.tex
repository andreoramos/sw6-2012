\section{Future Work}

A number of tasks did not get completed in this semester. As this project is properly going to be continued by others students, it is not that big of a problem. 

\subsection{Server syncronization}
One of the main things which did not get completet, due to when the component we needed was available, we did not have more time to implement it, was the syncronization with the server. This can be implemented by using the components which the server group made. This would also make the sync status component in the launcher work.

\subsection{Unit tests}
Unit testing is an essential part of the project. We did manage to do some unit tests, but for future work more unit tests could be made, and it should be an ongoing process instead of doing them at the end of the semester.
