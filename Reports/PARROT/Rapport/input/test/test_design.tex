Identifier: PARROT\#TD0100

\subsubsection*{Features to be tested}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Library navigation.
	\item Drag and drop pictograms onto the sentence board.
	\item Change the order pictograms appear in their library categories, using drag and drop.
	\item Check if these changes are saved.
	\item Audio functionality of pictograms.
	\item Playing sentences consisting of pictograms.
	\item Adding categories to the pictogram library.
	\item Adding pictograms to the library through the server/local database.
	\item Using the camera functionality.
	\item Storing pictures as pictograms in the library.
	\item Performance testing.
	\item Combining pictograms, and either parts of pictograms or other pictograms, to make new pictograms.
	\item Editing excisting pictograms.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Approach:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dynamic black box testing of the application on the target Android platform (Android 3.2).
	\item The Android tablet to be used for testing will be a Samsung Galaxy tablet 10.1 GT-P7510.
	\item If applicable, perform dynamic black box testing of the app on a later Android API (later than version 3.2) version on an  Android Virtual Device.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Test case identification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item LibNav
	\item DragDrop
	\item AudPlay
	\item SentPlay
	\item AddCat
	\item AddPic
	\item AddCam
	\item Perform
	\item EditPic
	\item CombiPic
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pass/fail criteria}
The app will have passed, if it manages to perform smoothly without any critical or serious errors, and with only minor cosmetic errors.
