\section{Test Result Document}

\subsubsection*{LibNav}
The Test was a success, we are able to scroll through individual categories aswell as change between several categories.\\

\textbf{Result:} Success.

\subsubsection*{DragDrop}
The drag and drop functionality works with partial success.
The application can successfully drag pictograms down onto the sentence board, as well as change their order on it.
The application also remembers their order successfully if the user was to change between tabs or pause and resume the application.\\

However, in testing we discovered a critical error. On the speech board, if a pictogram is picked up from the pictogram grid and dropped off in the category list, the system crashes.
This is not the case if you pick up a pictogram from the sentence board and drop it there.\\

\textbf{Result: }Partial Success.\\

\textbf{Note:} The discovered error can be fixed by removing an unintended feature from ``BoxDragListener.java''. This feature was intended to allow copying pictograms between categories, and was left in despite it having been discontinued. \\

\textbf{Update:} This error has been corrected by commenting out the code, so that it can be reimplemented correctly on a later date.

\subsubsection*{AudPlay}
We were able to drag a number of pictograms down to the sentence-board and play their individual sound snippets.\\

\textbf{Result:} Success.\\

\textbf{Note:} Some delay was noted in the audio, however, after consulting with the voice actor, who is a member of the group, we have concluded that it is 'empty sound' in the recording and not a delay in the system.

\subsubsection*{SentPlay}
This feature was not available for testing and will not be so before the deadline.\\

\textbf{Result:} N/A.

\subsubsection*{AddCat}
We were able to create 108 categories without incident and decided not to create any more since we felt that this would be a realistic test for the capacity for categories.\\

\textbf{Result:} Success.\\

\textbf{Note:} After performing the test, we noted that putting the application on pause and resuming it resulted in a crash. Doing so again with only the two default categories did not. Doing so with two new categories deleted the new categories.

\subsubsection*{AddPic}
This feature was not available for testing and will not be so before the deadline.\\

\textbf{Result:} N/A.

\subsubsection*{AddCam}
This feature was not available for testing and will not be so before the deadline.\\

\textbf{Result:} N/A.

\subsubsection*{Perform}
The application is smooth in performing its build in functions.
However, startup takes a measured  10 seconds and does not contain a loading screen to inform you that the application is actually running.\\

\textbf{Result:} Partial Success.

\subsubsection*{EditPic}
This feature was not available for testing and will not be so before the deadline.\\

\textbf{Result:} N/A.

\subsubsection*{CombiPic}
This feature was not available for testing and will not be so before the deadline.\\

\textbf{Result:} N/A.
