\section{Test Reflections}
We have been performing these tests in a manner most akin to dynamic black box testing.
Admittedly we have so in a test to pass manner, but we have tested avenues of actions that we expected to crash the system.
Also worth noting, is that our tests are not entirely black box testing, as we are the developers of the code. 
However, we did not look at the code immediately before testing, so it is close enough to black box testing in our own opinion.
We feel that we have learned more about test design, and that writing test cases are difficult, if you intend for them to give a good description of how to perform the actual tests.
