\section{Reflection}
In our own test phase have been performing these tests in a manner most akin to dynamic black box testing.
We have admittedly operated in a test to pass manner, but we have tested avenues of actions that we suspected could crash the system and did indeed do so.
Also worth noting about our test phase is that while we are developers of the code, it is still black box testing as the test cases were written before the code was.\\
Based on our Test Design's Fail/Succeed Criteria our app has Failed its first testing phase.
We experienced a Critical Error in the `DragDrop' test as the system crashed, and a severe error in the `Perform' test due to the poor handling of a slow application startup.
Of course these things can easily be fixed, but should not be considered acceptable in a finished product, due to our target group.

Our Usability Test was based on Dynamic White Box testing, as the questions were based on our knowledge of the code and the Application.\\
