\section{Introduction}
This chapter will document both our own testing phase as well as the usability test of PARROT, the latter performed in collaboration with all groups in the GIRAF Multi-Project.
While the usability test has been introduced in the common part of the report(introduction \autoref{intro}), the PARROT specific questions and results will be presented in this chapter.
The testing phase was performed in combination with the PE-course Test and Verification, so the design was written early in the development of our system according to method in the book ``Software Testing \cite{softtest}'' and the tests were performed after the development had been suspended.
Because of this, there are tests which cannot be performed due to a lack of functionality.
