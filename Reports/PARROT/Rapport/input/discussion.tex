\chapter{Discussion}
 
This semester we have been working on creating an android application for children with ASD. 
This has brought many new and interesting aspects we have not experienced in former projects. 
The idea of working in a multi project consisting of many groups that need to work together is completely new to us. 
Creating a project we know will be used in real life at some point is new as well, as is the agile development method we have been using. Finally we have not been working with android applications before, which have been rather interesting.\\ 
\\
\textbf{The multi project}\newline
This semester has differed from other semesters drastically by having a multi project instead of minor individual project. 
This have had a large impact on how the groups have had to work, and made it necessary to cope with problems that we have not encountered before.\newline
The groups are largely dependent on each other as all parts of the product needs to work together. 
We realized this early on, and have taken steps to increase communication between the individual groups. 
One of these steps were to hold weekly meetings, where we presented what we had been working on, as well as what we where going to work on.\newline 
This helped us to constantly know where everyone was at any given time, and helped communication between the groups greatly. 
At this meeting we also shared knowledge between groups, so that problems other groups could have run in to could be avoided by the remaining groups.\newline
Another step that has been taken is to eat together in the cafeteria. This have greatly improved communication between groups. 
Here we could talk about our free time, but we also talked about the projects more common aspects and helped communication on a daily basis without it being too formal.\newline
The dependency of other groups' work have also had a great impact on our work process. 
The good thing is that it has become far easier to specialize on one field. 
For instance have we used a database, but needed to create and maintain it, only ask the group handling the database for functionality. 
One of the problems, though, are that this also means that decisions can be made in the multi project or other groups instead of the individual groups.\newline
The individual groups need to accustom themselves to the fact that they might need to adjust their ideas to that of the multi project, or another group. 
For instance have we in our group wanted some extra tables in the database, but was decided against this.\newline
We believe this way of working give a better view on how work are done in the real world. 
The way we have been working this semester feels like working in a bigger corporation rather than in small individual project groups.  
The fact that the group rooms are shared by two groups only separated by cardboard stands resemble cubicle workstations, which have had decrease in efficiency of brainstorms and discussions, but increased communication across groups.\newline

\textbf{Agile method - SCRUM:}
Another new experience in this project is that we choose to work with a branch of development methods that we have not work with before. This new branch of development methods is the Agile paradigm, and the method that we have chosen is SCRUM. Agile methods promote adaptivity, and the idea of changing the plans on the way, working in iterative steps in close contact with the customer, analyzing, implementing and testing along the way.\newline
