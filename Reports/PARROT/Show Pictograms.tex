\section{Displaying Pictograms} %%Name of Feature.

\subsection{Problem}
We need a way import pictograms from the tablet storage drive and displaying them in the application so that they are ready to be used.
Displaying the pictograms also involves showing the associated text peices so that one can easily tell what it represents.
Areas where we will be displaying pictograms are the Talk board and the Management board.

\subsection{Solution}
Using Grid-view we can display both the pictograms and its text.
Rather than having the Grid-View display pictograms, we can display a Linear-Layout called ``PictogramView''.
This layout contains an Image-View with a pictogram and a Text-View with the associated text.
In that way we are able to show images with text, without having to imprint the text into the image.\\

In order to prepare the pictograms for display, we have to convert them to bitmaps before our Pictogram Adapter class can convert them into views.
