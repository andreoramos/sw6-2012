\subsection{Problem}
In PARROT, we uses a lot of classes specifically desgined for the given situation, such as the Pictogram class, the Category class, and the PARROTProfile class.
These classes contain the exact ammount of information needed in the application, and have been tailored to make it easier for the developpers to understand the flow of the program. However, since all the data used in PARROT is provided by the local database through the Admin functionality, there are some things to take into account.
The primary problem is that the data classes provided by the admin does not match the ones used in PARROT, and therefore needs to be transformed into PARROT objects before they can be used.
