\section{Colour Picker}%Come up with a better name
\subsection{Problem}
Since no two children with autism are the same, our application needs to be customizable. To represent this, we want our application to enable the user to configure the colours of different parts of the application.

\subsection{Solution}
To this problem, the solution is fairly simple. As the WOMBAT group have already found a solution to the problem, we are free to use that solution through data sharing. %is that what we called it, or was it something else?
They have shown they use an Android library project called AmbilWarna in their own project, which has been a great help to implementing it ourselves. The AmbilWarna library provides the application with a dialog box that allows the user to pick a colour as an input to the system.
