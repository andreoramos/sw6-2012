System definition for Gruppe sw603sf12

We are building a profile and configurations server for the android multiproject.
The purpose of this server is to keep track of the various users that make use of the android multiproject
product and all apps they use, as well as the configurations that are unique to the individual apps for that
specific user. The server will be build as a mySql server with a web interface for creating and managing profiles.
This web interface will be implemented on a tomcat webserver. We will also create a concept app for testing purposes.
