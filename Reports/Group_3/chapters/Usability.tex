In summation: 11 errors were defined as cosmetic, 7 as serious, and 4 as critical. \\

The critical errors were that the page broke down with an error. another critical error was that a phone number was required for a child, while it should be optional.
This is a requirement that has not been implemented, because we have not gotten the request before the test.
When prompted to add a guardian to a child there was great confusion of how to do that.
The reason is mainly because it is not placed in an intuitive place, and the test subjects had to get help from the test monitor.
The last critical error was the tags selection. The problem was that the user did not know, if a checkbox was assigned to the caption above or below. While this seems as a cosmetic or serious problem, at worst the system crashed. We have not been able to recreate this crash so we have rated the problem as critical although the system might not crash.

The rest of the problems found in the test was primarily things missing, bad layout, or misplaced functionality.
Missing things include ``back'' or ``home'' options from certain pages or captions that tells the user what certain fields do when filling out formulas. Bad layout is the main reason for confusion when using the system, this could be too much information presented to the user at once.
Misplaced functionality includes the placement of the profile list on the main page which a lot of users thought had to do with editing and adding profiles leading to big confusion.
