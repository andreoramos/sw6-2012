11 errors were defined as cosmetic, 7 as serious and 4 as critical. 

The critical errors where that the page broke down with an error which is an indication of programming errors which is clearly a show stopper. another critical error was that you had to include a phone number for a child while it should be optional. This is a requirement that has not been implemented because we have not gotten the request until now.
