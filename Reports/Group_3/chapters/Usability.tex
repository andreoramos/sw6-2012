Our usability test was carried out using the instant data analysis (IDA) method to process our results.

The results are as follow:

\begin{table}

11 errors were defined as cosmetic, 7 as serious and 4 as critical. 

The critical errors where that the page broke down with an error which is an indication of programming errors which is clearly a show stopper. another critical error was that you had to include a phone number for a child while it should be optional. This is a requirement that has not been implemented because we have not gotten the request before the test. When prompted to add a guardian to a child there was great confusion of how to do that. The reason is mainly because it is not placed in an intuitive place. To add a guardian you go to edit profile, choose the child and add it in the list box. This was not clear to the test subjects and they had to get help from the test monitor. The last critical error was the tags selection. The problem was that the user did not know if a checkbox was assigned to the caption left or right for it. While this seems as a cosmetic or serious problem at worst the system decided to crash in one of the tests. We have not been able to recreate this crash so we have rated the problem as critical although the system might not crash.

The rest of the problems found in the test was primarily things missing, bad layout or misplaced functionality. Missing things include ``back'' or ``home'' options from certain pages or captions that tells the user what certain fields do when filling out formulas. Bad layout is the main reason for confusion when using the system, this could be too much information presented to the user at once. Misplaced functionality includes the placement of the profile list on the main page which a lot of users thought had to do with editing and adding profiles leading to big confusion.
