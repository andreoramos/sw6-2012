A system to handle synchronization of data from the various GIRAF apps, and administrate this, has been implemented using a combination of Java, Java Servlets, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
Although a full implementation has not been achieved, the key functionality has been implemented. 

The GIRAF apps are not able to retrieve any data from the global database, but the only thing needed is to implement the code for this in Oasis. 

The web interface features full profile management, but the security issues of being able to have full control without authentication, needs to be addressed.
 Furthermore the usability test showed various problems in the web interface, shown in \autoref{tab:results}. The settings and stats are not implemented, as we chose to lower the priority of this part, and focus on the profile management.
 
The database is fully implemented, and meets all requirements stated in \autoref{subsec:databaseReq}

The system is partially implemented, but very open for future work.
