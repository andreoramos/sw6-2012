The database is designed in MySQL 5.1.61, and resembles the local database created by the ``Admin-group'' very closely -- the only difference is, that the Savanah database has two extra fields in the ``AuthUsers'' table: username and password. The reason for this is, that while all apps running on the android platform uses QR-codes for user authentication, this is not a fitting choice for the webinterface; it would be more complicated to scan the QR-code form a webcam to login, than to simply use a username and password combination.
