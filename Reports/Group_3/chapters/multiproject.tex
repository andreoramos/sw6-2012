Overall the multi project went well. Our cooperation with the other groups has been good.  When the other groups had new requirements they contacted the Oasis group who would then tell us. 

The multi project meetings have run without too much complication. In the beginning the meetings tended to get too long, but once we got a little more structure on the meetings, they also got shorter and easier to manage. We quickly found a routine for the meetings that made sure that there would always be progress, instead of us just getting stuck on the same topic without taking any decisions. 

During the usability test the groups had great cooperation, the only complications were technical issues. Every group participated and helped with both the preparation and execution of the test. 

There has not been a lot of complications for our group in regards to the multi project.
