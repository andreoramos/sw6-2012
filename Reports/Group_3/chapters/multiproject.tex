Overall the multi project went well. Our cooperation with the other groups have been good maybe because we have not been dependent on other than the Oasis group. When the other groups had new requirements they contacted the Oasis group who would then tell us. 

The multi project meetings have run without too much complication. In the beginning the meetings tend to get a little too long, but once we got a little more structure on the meetings they also got shorter and easier to handle. We quickly found a routine for the meetings that made sure that there would always be progress instead of us just getting stuck in the same topic and made no decisions. 

During the usability test the groups had a great cooperation with few complications. Every group participated and helped with both the preparation and execution of the test. 

There have not been a lot of complications for our group what the multi project concern.
