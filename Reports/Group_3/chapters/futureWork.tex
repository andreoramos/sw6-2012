%futureWork.tex
As previously stated, the system is very open for future work. In this section our suggestion on what to do is listed.

\subsection*{Serverside}
The most important thing to implement, is the possibility to enable communication between Savannah and Oasis. To do this, it is required to import the ServerConnection.jar into Oasis. This should, in theory, be enough to enable the communication. Furthermore, the communication protocol, must be changed form TCP/IP to SSL, when the system goes live, as this is a major security issue at the moment.

\subsection*{Web Interface}
The web interface is the part that has be most future work to be done:
\begin{description}
	\item[Main screen] The major focus should be on implementing a working main screen after login.
	\item[Security] Only authenticated uses should be able to access specific data.
	\item[Usability] The results of the usability test should be incorporated, to ease the use of the web interface
	\item[Eye candy] Color schemes, button layout etc. should be changed to fir the general ``atmosphere'' of the GIRAF system.
\end{description}
Implementing the main screen after login, will make it quite easy to increase the security. Furthermore most of the functionality needed beyond login (edit user, add pictures to the user, assign children/guardians, etc.) are already present, they merely needs to be relocated.
