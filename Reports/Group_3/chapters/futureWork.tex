In this section our suggestions for future development is listed.

\subsection*{Serverside}
Of the issues discussed in \autoref{sect:disc}, 
the most important thing to implement, is the communication between Savannah and Oasis. To do this, it is required to import the ServerConnection.jar file into Oasis. This should, in theory, be enough to enable the communication. Furthermore, the communication protocol, must be changed from TCP/IP to SSL, when the system goes live, as this is a major security issue at the moment.
As a product Savannah's server is still in a primitive state, and many hours of continued development could be put into it.


\subsection*{Web Interface}
The web interface is the part that has the most future work to be done:
\begin{description}
	\item[Main screen] The major focus should be on implementing a fully featured main screen after login.
	\item[Security] Only authenticated users should be able to access specific data.
	\item[Usability] The results of the usability test should be incorporated, to ease the use of the web interface.
	\item[Eye candy] Color schemes, button layout etc. should be changed to match the theme and layout of the GIRAF system.
\end{description}

Implementing the main screen after login, will make it quite easy to increase the security, this will also enable the implementation to retrieve and edit settings, and generation of stats. Furthermore most of the functionality needed beyond login (edit user, add pictures to the users, assign children to guardians, and vice verse, etc.) are already present, they merely need to be relocated.
