The previous chapter, is the common part of the report for the entire multi project. In the following chapter, we will develop a system to handle our task from our project definition:
\begin{quotation}
``Savannah provides Oasis with a way to synchronize tablets running GIRAF. Furthermore, a website is provided to ease administration of the synchronized data.''
\end{quotation}

\section{Problem Statement}
The problem definition has been used to create our problem statement:
\begin{quotation}
``How can we implement a system to handle the synchronization of data from the various GIRAF apps and administrate this?''
\end{quotation}

To be able to answer our problem statement, it is necessary to consider the following
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which requirements will there be to the system?
	\item How will the control of the data be handled?
	\item Which expectations does the end user have to our system?
	\item Which programming language should be used?
\end{itemize}

This chapter will focus on answering the problem statement, and in \autoref{recap} conclude on the project, a suggestion to future development and finally our experience of the multi project work form.
