\subsubsection*{The database}
Our database design is functional and well tested. We have made a lot of small adjustments throughout the project based on requirements from the other groups. We decided to freeze the database after third sprint because we had to change it during every sprint so to be able to start implementing we felt it was necessary. We have worked closely with the Oasis group when designing the database since our database should be equivalent to theirs, and that turned out to be a great success.

\subsubsection*{The Web Interface}
Our web interface was quite a challenge because we had no experience in java servlet. This resultet in a slow start because we had to learn how to use it. This was not accounted in the sprints resulting in delay in the beginning. Once we started getting more confident with java servlet the process sped up and we started to finish features during sprints.
We have used a lot of redundant code in the classes since we are still inexperienced and this code should be refactored in some way. At the end of sprint 5 we decided that we were done programming. There are still features that has not been implemented, these are described in our design.
In Retrospect we should have chosen a smaller part of the system to implement so that we would have time to learn java servlet and refactored the code. We have been successful with testing of the web interface both in the form of a mock up test, test cases, and usability test.
We have not been able to correct the mistakes but have documented them for use by next year's project.
