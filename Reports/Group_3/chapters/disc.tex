\subsubsection*{Agile Development}

\subsubsection*{The database}
Our database designed in close with the Oasis group, which was a great success, and is functional and well tested. We have made a lot of small adjustments throughout the project based on requirements from the other groups, but after the third sprint we froze it, as this was necessary to be able to start implementing the synchronization and web interface.

\subsubsection*{The Web Interface}
The web interface is not completely implemented. We have had to down prioritize the ``core'' of the system. The following parts are implemented, tested, and functional:
\begin{description}
	\item[Add Profile] This is the most important part of the system, as the possibility to add new users are essential. 
\end{description}
Our web interface was quite a challenge because we had no experience in java servlet. This resultet in a slow start because we had to learn how to use it. This was not accounted in the sprints resulting in delay in the beginning. Once we started getting more confident with java servlet the process sped up and we started to finish features during sprints.
We have used a lot of redundant code in the classes since we are still inexperienced and this code should be refactored in some way. At the end of sprint 5 we decided that we were done programming. There are still features that has not been implemented, these are described in our design.
In Retrospect we should have chosen a smaller part of the system to implement so that we would have time to learn java servlet and refactored the code. We have been successful with testing of the web interface both in the form of a mock up test, test cases, and usability test.
We have not been able to correct the mistakes but have documented them for use by next year's project.

\subsubsection*{The Server Software}
\begin{description}
 \item[No Synchronization done] One of the goals of the project was to synchronize data with the local database, and a api package
