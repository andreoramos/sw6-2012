\chapter{Code Testing}
Though having testable code has not been a priority, see \autoref{product_quality} for more information, preparations were made in case there was time for doing dynamic testing. 
These preparations revolved around dynamic white-box testing, and includes some test cases for functions in the code that would allow for some unit testing to take place. 
These test cases can be seen in \autoref{test_cases}. 
A few test cases were run as a proof of concept, but these were simple cases, that proved that we did not have the time to run more extensive testing. 

Had there been time to run these unit tests, the next step would have been to run mutation analysis on them to see if the existing cases exercised the code well enough, or the set of test cases should be rewritten to further exercise the code. \\

But while there has not been much time for dynamic testing, static testing has been employed vigorously, though not in a formal fashion. 
Static black-box testing has been employed when the design of the product has been discussed, and the design has gone through many iterations and refinements because of it. 
Discussions about the design have been common, though more so early in the project, and iteration has been important for all parts of the product, as is also supported through the agile working process employed. 
See \autoref{launcher_work_form} for more details on the working process. \newline

Pair programming and the refactoring employed resulted in static white-box testing of the project, as both of these have code reviewing as an essential component.
