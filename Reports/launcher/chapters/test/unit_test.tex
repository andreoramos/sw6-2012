\section{Code Testing}
This sections presents the testing that had been planned for the product. 

Though having testable code has not been a priority (see \autoref{product_quality} for more information), preparations were made in case there was time for doing dynamic testing. 
These preparations revolved around dynamic white-box testing, and included one or two test cases for many different functions in the code that would allow for some unit testing to take place. 
These test cases can be seen in \autoref{test_cases}.
