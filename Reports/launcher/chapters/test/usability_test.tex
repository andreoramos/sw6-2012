\subsection{Test Circumstances/Something}
\todo{Lav overskrift}
As described in \todo{Referer til common report}, only one usability test was performed. 
This was deemed adequate, as the customers had provided continuous positive feedback on the product. 
As such, the test was also performed late in the project as a means of verifying what level of usability had been achieved, rather than using the test to find problems that would then be fixed as the project came underway. \newline
The test was set up to test for both discoverability and usability. 
Discoverability was tested as the customers had mentioned the high costs associated with certified learning courses during interviews (see \autoref{interviews}) as a disadvantage of current systems, and making functionality easy to discover would help reduce the need for such courses.
