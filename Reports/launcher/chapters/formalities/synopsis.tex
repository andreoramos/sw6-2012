Institutions for children with ASD currently employ analogue tools which are suitable for digitalization.
Such digitalized tools exist today, but are however not cost effective for the institutions.
The ``Launcher''-project, as part of a larger multi-project, aims to solve some of the issues by creating parts of a free platform for Android\texttrademark  \hspace{1pt} tablets, which contains digitalized tools suitable for the institutions in questions.
The parts created in this project are a launcher, a component that provides access to other GIRAF components, and a shared library of visual elements, to improve concistency across components running on the platform.
