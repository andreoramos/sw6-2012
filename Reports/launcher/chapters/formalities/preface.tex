\chapter{Preface}
\label{preface}


\section{Quotations} are the words of another person along with a source.
The source of the citation will either be in the text immediately before or after, or could potentially be incorporated into the quote as shown in the example below: \\

%\myQuoteA{This is an example of a quotation.}{X, p.~Y}

\section{References} are references to sections, figures, code snippets, chapters or parts written elsewhere in the report. 
This could look like the following:\\

This is explained in Section~X.Y.

\section{Code examples} are written in a special environment so they are easy to read and recognize. 
%Examples can be seen in Code~snippet~\ref{chelloworld}. 
Whenever there is a sequence of three dots (``...'') in a code snippet, it means that we have omitted some content, which is not important in that specific context.

%\begin{lstlisting}[style=java, caption={Code example of a hello world program written in C.}, label=chelloworld]
%#include<stdio.h>
%
%main()
%{
%    printf("Hello World");
%}
%\end{lstlisting}
