\label{backlog:child_mode}

There should be implemented another mode of the launcher which is called child mode. This mode is only for children and is minded on them using it alone without an gardian. In this mode all settings and such for is removed and everytime an app is clicked it launches directly with the childs preferences instead of showing the select profile screen.
