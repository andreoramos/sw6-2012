\subsection{Hide apps}
\label{backlog:hide_apps}

This feature was meant to be an integration in the drawer \autoref{GUI:drawer} where it should be placed just under the colorpicker. The functionality of this app board is that when an app is unused or should not be acessable for a either a child or a guardian it could be put into the drawer and if there was an app in the drawer which the user needed it could be dragged back to the app grid.
