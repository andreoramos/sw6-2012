\subsection{Logo screen loading}
\label{backlog:logo_screen_loading}

There needs to be implemented a way of showing if the logo screen have crashed. The reason is that the logo screen only should run in two seconds and if it takes longer the launcher is probably crashed. 
A possible solution is to implement an loading bar or other form for loading animation.
