\chapter{Backlog}
\label{chap:backlog}

This chapter contains the entire backlog of the project, with the backlog entries divided into two groups, \emph{implemented}, and \emph{unimplemented}. 
The backlog entries, during the development period, were prioritized based on their relevance for the design and the usability of the product, with the highest priority entries being implemented first.
They are not presented in a prioritized order in this report.
