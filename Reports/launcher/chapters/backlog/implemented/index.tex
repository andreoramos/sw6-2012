\label{backlog_implemented}

%\input{chapters/backlog/implemented/authentication}
\subsection{Authentication}
\label{backlog:authentication}
Authentication gives protection of private data, and allows the launcher to know the identify of the current user.
QR-codes are used to store the credentials of the users, and allows for authentication via the tablets camera, scanning a provided QR-code.

\subsection{Autologin}
\label{backlog:autologin}
The autologin feature enables guardians to start the launcher without authentication, if authentication was performed within the last eight hours.

%\input{chapters/backlog/implemented/GUIcomponents}
\subsection{GUI components}
\label{backlog:GUI_components}
GUI components are shared using a public library, allowing \girafapp[]s to use the same dialogs, buttons, tooltips, widgets etc.

\subsubsection{App grid}
\label{backlog:appgrid}
Launchable \girafapp[]s are launchable through a grid of apps, called ``app grid''.

%\input{chapters/backlog/implemented/homescreen}
\subsection{Homebar and drawer}
\label{backlog:homebar_drawer}
Information is accessible through a bar -- called ``homebar'' -- in the means of text, images and widgets.
Additional information and functionality is hidden within the homebar, in a so called drawer, simply called ``drawer''. The homebar and the drawer is shown together with the app gridd, described in \autoref{backlog:appgrid}.

%\input{chapters/backlog/implemented/logoscreen}
\subsection{Logo screen}
\label{backlog:logo_screen}
While the launcher is initially loading, a splash screen containing the logo of the \giraf[] platform is shown, allerting the user that the system is loading.

%\input{chapters/backlog/implemented/profileselect}
\subsection{Profile select}
\label{backlog:profile_select}
Upon launching an app from the app grid, choosable child profiles are listed, such that the user is allowed to select one of them, prior to app execution.
%Profile select was implemented so an app needs to be started for a specific child. The screen holds the \giraf[] logo and a list where all the children the currently logged in guardian have access to.
