\subsection{ The predefined colors} 
In the color picker there are predefined ten colors for the user to use on the app icons. The decision on the ten different colors was done from how many apps there are in the \giraf[] system right now and how many new ones there would come the next couple of years. Here it was found that ten was a sufficient count of colors. \\
The reason why there are predefined colors in the \giraf[] system is that if the developers made their app icons all white the contrast would always be sufficient. So there would not be any problem with users not seeing an icon no matter what background color there was chosen.  Another reason was that it was important to control the functionality where the apps could use the same background color in the app as the icon background color. \\
If this was not done there could be problems like e.g. the user could set the icon background to white and if the icon was white then the user could not see what app it was and vice versa. Another problem could be that if the apps used the functionality where they can set the same background color in the app as the icon background color there could be none sufficient contrast. This would make it impossible for the user to see anything in the app.
