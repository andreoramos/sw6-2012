\section{Internal Architecture}
This section will explain the internal architecture of the launcher, this is every dependency inside the launcher.
Being able to launch an \girafapp[] as a specific guardian requires the user to interact such that the launcher knows which guardian the user represents.

Authentication was chosen, as each modulated child and guardian contains private data and therefore needs to be protected. QR-codes was chosen as means of authentication, as they provide a level of security.
An alternative to QR-codes could be a \emph{username-password} method, where each user have their own username, with an private password. The system is designed to have the two modes: guardian- and child mode\todo{ref to backlog}. A username-password combination requires the user to remember their credentials, whereas some \autists[] have problems with it. \myQuote{Some \autists[] can have problems remembering a username and password  -  Drazenko Banjak}

QR codes provides a physical way of storing the user credentials and allows for other users to take responsibility of the QR-code, such as a \guardian[] carrying a QR-code of a \autist[].

QR-codes can be scanned by a built-in camera on tablets and can be printed using standard paper and printer equipment. 

QR-codes are copyable, by e.g. a copymachine, and therefore must be kept away from untrusted users, if they should not be used by people for which they were not intended.

To sum up, QR-codes are chosen because of they improve usability, despite of their ability to be copied.\todo{Ulrik, er dette i orden?}

\autoref{fig:authentication_design} shows the states of the \activity{Authentication}. The simple ones is the start and stop states and they does just what they say. The interessting states is the ``Scan QR code'' state where when a user scans an QR code there is two path: One is that the QR code is invalid. The other one is if the QR code is valid then it leeds to another state where the activity checks the identity of the QR code scanned if it is not an known identity it is rejected else the \activity{Authentication} logs in the user and termintes.
