\section{Features}
To specificy a more detailed design, the need for narrowing down the abstract states into features are required.
The states are divided into feature groups, which can seen in \autoref{fig:design_diagram}.
Each feature's functionality is defined by each outgoing action from the states the feature originates from.

\subsection{Authentication}
\label{design:authentication}
The authentication feature is illustrated in \autoref{fig:authentication_design}. 
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
The first step to enter after initiating Authentication, is to scan a QR-code.
Upon scanning a QR-code, there is two possible outcomes: The QR-code is invalid, as the credentials it represent doesn't exist in the GIRAF database, or it is QR-code containing valid credentials that exist in the database.
In case of the QR-code being valid, the process then enters it second step. The second step consist of the user needs to confirm the identity, or reject if identity represented on the system does not match the user's identity. 

\subsection{App management}
\label{design:app_manangement}
The app management feature is illustrated in \autoref{fig:appmanagement_design}. 
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
User action is the first step of the app management feature, and controls the interaction with the user.
One of the actions the user is able to make, is to change settings regarding the current authenticated user's apps.
The user does that by interacting with the drawer \todo{insert ref to preanalysis}.
The drawer can be opened or closed.
The closed state is when the drawer is sled all the way to the left.
The open state is when the drawer is when is not sled all the way to the left, and is below or at its maximum span.
When the drawer is opened, it is possible to change a color of an app.
This is done by dragging a color from the color table, onto an app and releasing in order to make the app change color.

Another action the user is able to make, is to retrieve information regarding the system. T
