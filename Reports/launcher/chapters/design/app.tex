\subsection{Apps and the App Grid}
\label{GUI:app}

The way the apps are listed is somewhat the same as in any other launcher but somethings are different. All app icons is designed to have a background which can change color. Because of this it was needed to make a set of guidelines on how all app-developers should make their icons for their apps. These guidelines states that the icons should be mono-color. Mono-color means that the icons is made in one color and this one color in this case is white.
The background also got the round corners which all clickable buttons have see \autoref{GUI:buttons} and the backgrounds was design so that the buttons got bigger to accomondate that children have worse fine fingerskills than adults \todo{Mikael Skov: fine fingerskills reference}.

Another change is that the App Grid scrolls horizontal instead of vertical. The though is that it works better with the drawer meantioned in \autoref{GUI:drawer}. But making the App Grid scroll horizontal did that there was needed another way of telling the user where they was in the grid. Therefore the grid was thought to have some scrollbar indication in the bottom of the grid.
