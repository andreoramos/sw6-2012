\section{Profile selection}
\label{design:profile_selection}
\subsection{Requirements}
Because only the guardian mode was implemented there was a requirement for choosing which child an app should be started for in the \giraf[] system.
\subsection{Solution}
Being able to start \giraf[] apps with a childs preferences requires to know which child is ment. Therefore it was choosen to make an profile selection screen where the guardian currently using the \giraf[] system can see a list of all the children which he has associated.
