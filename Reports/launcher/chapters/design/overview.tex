\chapter{Overview}
\label{sec:design_overview}
This section presents an overview of the design work done on the overall product, and the following sections present details on specific features in the launcher. \newline

The design of the \giraf[] launcher is centered around high usability and specific functionality requirements. 
These functionality requirements come from both the customers of the project, and other \localgroup[]s in the multi project, and include only the requirements that are within the scope of this project. \newline
The requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow \guardian[]s to launch apps.
\item Allow each \guardian[] to customize their experience with the launcher. 
\item Allow apps to work for a specific \autist[].
\end{itemize}

High usability has been prioritized, both because it was requested by the customer, but also because the launcher is planned to be expanded and usable by \autists[] later on.
See \autoref{Preanalysis:Usability_for_children} for more information on the usability requirements of children. \newline
