\noindent Authentication consists of two steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Validating
	\item Confirmation
\end{enumerate}
Validation is needed to ensure privacy. Confirmation is a requirement as error prevention, in case validation with a wrong identity is performed.
As stated, being able to launch a \girafapp[] as a specific guardian requires the user to interact such that the launcher knows which guardian the user represents.
As stated in \autoref{design:authentication:requirements}, privacy is required since each modelled child and guardian contains private data and therefore needs to be protected.
QR-codes were chosen as the means of authentication, as they provide some level of security.
An alternative to QR-codes could be a \emph{username-password} combination, where each user has their own username, with a private password.
As the launcher is developed towards being a tool usable by both guardians and children, a username-password combination can diminish usability for children, as it requires the user to remember their credentials, and some \autists[] have problems with this.

QR-codes provides a physical way of storing the user credentials and allows for other users to take responsibility of the QR-code, such as a \guardian[] carrying a QR-code of a \autist[].
They can be scanned by a built-in camera on tablets and can be printed using standard paper and printer equipment. 
They can be copied, by e.g. a copy machine, and therefore must be kept away from untrusted users, if they should not be used by people for which they were not intended.
To sum up, QR-codes are chosen because of they improve usability, despite of their ability to be copied.  \\\todo{Ulrik, er dette i orden? Bullet points plox}

This leads to the functionality solution seen in \autoref{fig:authentication_design}.

Upon scanning a QR-code, there is two possible outcomes: The QR-code is invalid, as the credentials are not recognized, or the QR-code contains credentials which are recognized.
In case of the QR-code being valid, the process then enters it second step. The second step consist of the user needs to confirm the identity, or reject if identity represented on the system does not match the user's identity.

\subsubsection{GUI}
The GUI components of the authentication design, can be seen in \autoref{fig:authentication_gui_design_init}.

The camera border helps distinct the camera feed from the rest of the layout, but it also provides feedback upon scanning by changing colors --- this can be seen in \autoref{app:design:authentication}. To scan, the backfacing camera feed is shown inside of the camera border. A scanner guide is shown on top of the feed, to help the user aim during the scanning process and possibly enhance the feel of the design being a scanner\todo{OK sentence?}. On the left hand side an animation is shown, to guide the user of how he or she should interact with the system.
