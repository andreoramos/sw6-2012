\subsection{Buttons and button design}
This section will explain the button design in the giraf system and how they were intended.

To make the overall consistency and usability better there were made some button guidelines. These were made to be used in the \giraf[] GUI library and thereby in the hole \giraf[] system including the launcher.

These guidelines included colors the buttons should have. The edge of the button should be a dark brown and the inner should be yellow and hereby the buttons are using the commen \giraf[] colors. Buttons should also have round corners if they are clickable and if they for some reason are not they should be squared. This can be seen in \autoref{fig:buttons}.
