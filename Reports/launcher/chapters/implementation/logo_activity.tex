\section{Logo Activity}
This section will explain the activity \texit{Logo Activity}\todo{Remember to explain that activity refers to Android Activity} and how it is utilized.\\\\
This activity is only seen by the user when the launcher is not already on the Back Stack\todo{Android ref}.\\
The important thing about this activity is that it runs in a \verb+Thread+ and uses \verb+synchronized()+ to wait an amount of time until the Authentication Activity or the Home Activity is most certainly done. Which activity that should be started is decided by the \verb+Tools.sessionExpired(mContext)+ method. 
This method returns true or false over if the users login is still valid or not. If the login is still valid and the id which is still logged in, in the \verb+sharedPreferences+ do not return \verb+null+.
It will only return null if the user do not exsist in the system. The user should be taken to the Home Activity else they should be presented with the Authentication Activity so they can login.
When the right \verb+Intent+ is build, the activity is started and the thread is stopped ad finish.
All this can be seen in \autoref{lst:logoActivity} and the final design of the implementation can be seen in \autoref{fig:logo-activity_1} and \autoref{fig:logo-activity_2} on page \autopageref{fig:logo-activity_1}\\
Unfortunately due to errors in the Oasislib the out commented code was not tested.
