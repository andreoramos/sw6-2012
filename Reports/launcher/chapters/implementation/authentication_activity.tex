\section{Authentication Activity}

This activity implements the design described in \autoref{design:authentication} and is the first activity the user will face when using the \giraf[] system. It is also the current lock screen which is used by WOMBAT \autoref{backlog:lock_screen}.

This activity was implemented using ZXing \citep{web:ZXing}, pronouced Zebra crossing, which is a libaray under Apache 2.0. This library is made for use with Android for scanning 1D and 2D QR codes.

\todo{Thomas eller Magnus, explain what was changed in ZXing.}

There is implemented instructions and illustrations as mentioned in \autoref{design:authentication}. There is also implemented a gesture, a 500ms vibration, for showing the user that the QR code was scanned correct because some of the users had trouble seeing the login button when it appeard.
