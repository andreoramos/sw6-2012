\section{Authentication Activity}
This section will explain the \activity{AuthenticationActivity}.

This activity implements the design described in \autoref{design:authentication} is the first one the user will face when using the \giraf[] system. It is also the current lock screen which is used by Wombat. 

This activity was implemented using ZXing which is a libaray under Apache 2.0. This libarary is called Zebra Crossing and is made for use with Android for scanning 1D and 2D QR codes.

There were also implemented the instructions and illustrations talked about in \autoref{design:authentication}. There is also implemented an gesture, a short vibration, for showing the user that the QR code was scanned correct because some customers had trouble seeing the login button when it appeard.
