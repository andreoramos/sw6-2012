Figure~\ref{fig:activity_diagram} shows the activity structure of the \giraf[] launcher. Every transition with a \verb+destroy()+ box on it gets the activity starting the transition destroyed. Everytime the user is outside the launcher and hits the home button they will end up in the \activity{HomeActivity}, if the \giraf[] launcher is set to the default launcher.
