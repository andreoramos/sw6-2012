\subsection{Apps and the App Grid}
\label{GUI:app}

The way the apps are listed is somewhat the same as in any other launcher but somethings are different. All app icons is designed to have a background which can change color. Because of this it was needed to make a set of guidelines on how all app-developers should make their icons for their apps. These guidelines states that the icons should be mono-color. Mono-color means that the icons is made in one color and this one color in this case is white.
The background also got the round corners which all clickable buttons have see \autoref{GUI:buttons} and the backgrounds was design so that the buttons got bigger to accomondate that children have worse fine fingerskills than adults as seen in \autoref{Preanalysis:Usability_for_children}.

Another change is that the App Grid scrolls horizontal instead of vertical. The though is that it works better with the drawer meantioned in \autoref{GUI:drawer}. Making the App Grid scroll horizontal ment that there was needed a way of telling the user where they was in the grid because this is not implicit. Therefore the grid should have some scrollbar indication in the bottom of the grid.
