\subsection{Drawer}
\label{GUI:drawer}

The drawer is a feature where the user can hide tools when they are not needed for a while. The drawer can be said to be some kind of toolbox. 

The drawer is design to be a toolbox which can hide different things from the user when it is not needed. The tought was that it should be possible to put anything the user did not need for launching apps in the drawer. It was designed to look like a real drawer where the inside of the drawer is darker than then front of the drawer.

\subsubsection{Homebar}
The homebar is the thing thats seperates the appgrid and the drawer from each other. This was done so the user did not have functionality for changing different things floating around with the apps which is only intended to start programs with.
The homebar also acts like a form for container holding functionality that always should be avaliable to the user. These are the widgets which can logout, show the date and tell the user if they are connected to the \giraf[] system.


\subsubsection{The handle}
The handle is suppose to show the user that there is a possibility for dragging and in that way open the drawer. This was decided to be shown by making a cut in the homebar edge and using the brown color there is also used inside the drawer, this was done for consistency.
