There are two diffrent groups of people which is intented to use the \giraf[] system. The first is the guardians which should have their own mode because guardians can have more than one child and therefore need, in their everyday for helping the children, to have some kind of choosing mecanisme for what child to help. They should also have the posibility for seeing all information and data in the system. The second group is the children and they should have less information i.e. only have access to their own information and data.
It was decided only to work with the guardians because it was the most comprehensive. But there will still be incorporated the usability found in \autoref{Preanalysis:Usability_for_children}.
The part of the launcher for children is called child mode and the part for guardians got the name guardian mode.
