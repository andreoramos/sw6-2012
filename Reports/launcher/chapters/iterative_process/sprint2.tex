\section{Sprint 2}% - March $26th$ to April $4th$}

\textbf{Duration:} Ten half days. \newline

The focus of this sprint was to get implementation started. 
As a base design was already in place, ressources were mainly put into getting to know the system and the requirements for making a launcher. 
This led to features like app arrangement, app loading and a login system being the priority, with services for the other \localgroup{}s not yet becoming important. 
At the end of the sprint, these features had been roughly implemented. \newline
An issue came up at a meeting, as one of the \localgroup{}s had trouble with their members showing up to the meetings on time. 
A quick effort was made to solve the issue, and though some disagreement occurred, several possible resolutions were presented by the \globalgroup{}.
