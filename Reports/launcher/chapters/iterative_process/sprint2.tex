\section{Sprint 2}% - March $26th$ to April $4th$}

\textbf{Duration:} Ten half days. 

The focus of the second sprint was to start implementing the base design, which was already in place.
This led to building the parts of the launcher allowing apps to be arranged and loaded, and creation of an authentication system being the priority for the sprint, with no requirements yet coming from the other \localgroup[]s. 
At the end of the sprint, these features had been roughly implemented. \newline
An issue came up at a meeting, as one of the \localgroup{}s had trouble with their members showing up to the meetings on time. 
The issue was discussed on the meeting, and rules were agreed upon to help alleviate the issue.
