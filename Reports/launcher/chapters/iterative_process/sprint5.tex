\section{Sprint 5 - May $7th$ to May $11th$}

\textbf{Duration:} Six half days. \newline

This was the final sprint where implementation took place. 
Refining existing features was therefore the highest priority, and scope adjustments were made to cut features that would not be ready before the sprint was over. 
The sprint was ended with a refactoring period, where the entire code base was checked and complex parts were rewritten to increase readability. \newline
The planning meeting for this sprint was also the first meeting where each \localgroup{} made a formal presentation of their near final products.
